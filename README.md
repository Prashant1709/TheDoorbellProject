#Raspberry Pi Face Recognition Doorbell Project

This project uses a Raspberry Pi to build a smart doorbell that uses face recognition to detect who is at the door. If the person is already known, the room is unlocked, and the lights, AC temperature, and music are set to their mood with a welcome announcement and a weather report. However, if it's someone unknown, the owner is notified via email with the picture and an option to take further action.
